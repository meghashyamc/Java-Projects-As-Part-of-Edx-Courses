## This is the package given at the beginning of the project.

The Simple Drawing Player given plays a sound when a rectangle is drawn (and it has a few more features all related to drawing rectangles). 

The aim of the project was to add oval functionality (currently non-existant) to the Simple Drawing Player. So, drawing an oval had to be supported and that had to lead to playing of a certain sound. All functionality that the rectangle had earlier, had to also be supported for ovals now.

This is a screenshot of the Simple Drawing Player when it only supports rectangles:

<b>You can watch a video of how the original Simple Drawing Player looks (before oval functionality) by pursuing the link below.</b> The video doesn't have sound but when any object is moved, it does make a sound in the <i>actual</i> application:
