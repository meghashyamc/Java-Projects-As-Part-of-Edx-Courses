## This is the package given at the beginning of the project.

The Simple Drawing Player given plays a sound when a rectangle is drawn (and it has a few more features all related to drawing rectangles). 

The aim of the project was to add oval functionality (currently non-existant) to the Simple Drawing Player. So, drawing an oval had to be suppored and that had to lead to playing of a certain sound. All functionality that the rectangle had earlier, had to also be supported for ovals now.

This is a screenshot of the Simple Drawing Player when it only supports rectangles:
