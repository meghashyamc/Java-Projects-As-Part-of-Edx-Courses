The original Simple Drawing Player played a sound when a rectangle is drawn (and it had a few more features all related to drawing rectangles).

This new Simple Drawing Player plays a sound when an oval is also drawn. It has a few more features related to drawing ovals. 

This is a screenshot of the Simple Drawing Player when it supports both ovals and rectangles:
