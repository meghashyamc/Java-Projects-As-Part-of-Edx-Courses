## This is the package after the completion of the project.

The original Simple Drawing Player played a sound when a rectangle is drawn (and it had a few more features all related to drawing rectangles).

This *new* Simple Drawing Player *also* plays a sound when an oval is also drawn. It has a few more features related to drawing ovals. 

This is a screenshot of the Simple Drawing Player when it supports both ovals and rectangles:

<b>You can view a video of how the application looks like after added oval functionality below.</b> The original application plays sounds when shapes are drawn or moved although there's no sound in the video below.
