## This is the package after the completion of the graphical Java appplication - Twitter Mapper

<i>This application allows the user to specify keywords of interest, and monitors tweets from a service that samples Twitter in real time (or replays tweets that were previously recorded). It also plots the location of the user the originated the tweet on a map of the world. To do this, the app makes use of an existing geographical mapping library and the Twitter API.</i>

- (excerpt from the project description page on Edx.org.)

<b>At the start of the project</b>, a screen was displayed that had a map of the world and a query box. Nothing happened when you typed a query into the box (except for the query getting displayed as part of a list).

Here's how the screen looked <b><i>at the start of the project</i></b>:

The final, completed Twitter Mapper:
 
- processes <i>and, or, not</i> queries
- displays markers on the map based on the keywords entered 
- displays the profile picture of the tweeter and a part of the tweet when you hover over the markers
- the markers are shown either based on a live Twitter feed (so people who have just used your keyword in their Tweet will show up) or based on a given playback feed.

Here's a screenshot of the final Twitter Mapper:
